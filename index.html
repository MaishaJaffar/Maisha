<body><h2> <b>fashion <br>  </h2> <p> Hi im Maisha!<br>>
Well as you can tell I love fashion.<br > <strong>I know many styles and if you ask  me for tips ill give you some tips</p><br> some of the styles I know are either
really complicated or very easy ! One of the  most well known style in japan is called Igari , now you might be like "Maisha you arent just throwing some random <br>
 words are you?" truth is im not so u can relax . </b></b></p></body>

<body2><p> <h2> "Maisha what is igari?" <br>
Like i mentioned igari is verey popular in Japan and the reason why I chose this style is beacuse it comes with an easy fit and a complicated one,<br> 
in this case we will start with the easy one. "Maisha what do you mean easy?" ,<br> well what i mean by easy is that you can really just not layer alot with your<br>
clothes and be simple with maybe a thin scarf,a short dress over some baggy jeans, with a cross body bag and beret  voilà your easy igari fit!<br>
well if you noticed it was short simple and low effort where else in a complicated one you would have to put dozensts of clips a dress over a skirt ,thights over <br>
leggins so many other stuff it will take you over an hour! <br><h2></p> <img src=igari outffit.jpg" alt="igari outffit">
